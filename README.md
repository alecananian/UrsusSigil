# Ursus Sigil

A library for generating Urbit sigils.

> Note: This library is a work in progress.

## Installation

Ursus Sigil can be installed using Cocoapods by adding the following line to your podfile:

```ruby
pod 'UrsusSigil', '~> 0.1'
```

I can probably help set up Carthage or Swift Package Manager support if you need it.
